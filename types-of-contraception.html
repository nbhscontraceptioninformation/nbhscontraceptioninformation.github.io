                            It should be noted that only condoms and vasectomies are available for men.
                            <br>
                            <h2 class="subtitle">Condoms</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Condoms are a type of contraception worn over the penis, and is generally made of latex, though other options are available if one is allergic.
                                    Just like other types of contraception, the purpose is to prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections ("STIs") and unwanted pregnancies.
                                </p>
                            <h2 class="subtitle">Birth Control ("The Pill")</h2>
                                <p>
                                    There are multiple possible active ingredients in birth control pills. People are encouraged to see which one works best for them. 
                                    They can contain synthetic or bioidentical versions of female hormones: namely oestrogen (oestradiol), and progestins (progesterone), which are normally produced in womens' ovaries.
                                </p>
                            <h2 class="subtitle">IUD / IUS</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Intrauterine devices and systems are small t-shaped devices that fit in the womb. An IUD is made of plastic and copper, and is a long lasting and reversible method of contraception. They can stay in the womb for five to ten years, depending on their type. Further, they are an effective form of emergency contraception (i.e. if one is concerned about an unwanted pregnancy) if fitted within  five days of raw (unprotected) sex.
                                    They contain hormones that release to prevent pregnancy, and also can prevent heavy periods, and have a very high success rate (99%).
                                    An IUS is similar, except they release progestorone, which prevents pregnancy. It is used for the same or similar reasons.
                                </p>
                            <h2 class="subtitle">Contraceptive Injections</h2>
                                <p>
                                    A long lasting, reversible method of contraception, that acts by using progesterone. It is also 99% reliable, though requires an injection every 12 weeks. An implant can be used instead, which lasts 3 years.
                                </p>
                            <h2 class="subtitle">Tube Tying</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Tube tying is an effective method of contraception that effectively prevents women from being pregnant. It is reversible with surgery, but for all intents and purposes is permanent. It is done by cutting or blocking the fallopian tubes, thus entirely stopping eggs from being available for fertilisation. This is a minor operation, and most women who undergo it are able to return home on the same day.
                                </p>
                            <h2 class="subtitle">Vasectomy</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Vasectomy, commonly referred to as 'male sterilisation', is a simple, reliable method of contraception. It is permanent, though can be reversed with surgery. It is quick and relatively painless and stops the travel of spermatoza through the urethra.
                                </p>
                            <h2>Abstince</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Of course, abstinence has a 100% success rate, though it is not feasible for the vast majority of the population. Further, it does not prevent against STIs in any way, but obviously there would be no unwanted pregnancies if one abstains until they want a child. 
                                </p>
