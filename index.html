                                    We aim to provide a variety of content. 
                                    We are inspired by recent marketing campaigns, namely the <a href="http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/peach-eggplant-star">recent campaign by <em>Celebrate Condoms</em></a>, who had an ad targetting gay and bisexual men. 
                                    Another source of inspiration for us was the <a href="https://www.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/national-condom-day-is-your-valentine-covered/3334919/"><em>National Condom Day</em></a>, which had a focus on consent and the importance of it. There were, of course, some examples that inspired us what <em>not</em> to do. A prime example of this is <a href="https://www.hit.com.au/scoopla/life/these-safe-sex-campaign-condom-wrappers-have-caused-major-outrage">campaign telling people '<em>donut</em> go further without consent'</a>, which sadly got percieved as a second meaning.

                                <p>
                                    We are displaying this educational content in the form of a website as this is cheap and is able to reach a wide audience. After all, we are a group of high school students. Further, people can share it easily as people can copy the URL in to a post on a social media platform of their choice. 
                                </p>

                                    Some may wonder why we chose contraception as a topic to do a website on. We are doing this because contraception allows for the prevention of sexually transmitted illnesses, as well as unwanted pregnancies. There are also a variety of possible methods of contraception methods, with many people not aware of those available. The purpose of the website is to bring awareness to young people about the purpose of contraceptives. There are places where it is unavailable, such as India. They represent one fourth of the world population and face many severe risks to their sexual health. For this reason, Australians should be aware of how having access to these is a boon to bodily autonomy and should be well educated in this.
